        What is CSS?
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="h">
            CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets.
        </li>
        <li class="h">
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
        </li>
        <li class="h">
            <b><strike>CSS is not necessary</strike> <mark style=" color: brown;">CSS saves a lot of work.</mark></b>It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.
        </li>
        <li class="h">

                <u>
                    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

        CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="lo">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li class="lo">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li class="lo">External - by using a element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="lo">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,
            <mark style=" color: brown; font-weight: bold;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,
                </mark>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and
        it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or of styles can applied to element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
